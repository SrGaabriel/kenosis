# 🕊️ kenosis

Kenosis is a serialization and deserialization library for Lean 4. It is written to be ergonomic, generic, and extensible. Kenosis plans to support a variety of serialization formats, including but not limited to JSON, TOML, and binary formats.

# ✨ Etymology

Kenosis comes from the Greek word kenóō, meaning “to empty.” In the context of serialization, it evokes the idea of reducing an object to its essential form, stripping away runtime behavior and context so that its core data can be stored or transmitted. Deserialization then reconstructs the object from this essential representation, allowing it to be used again in memory.
